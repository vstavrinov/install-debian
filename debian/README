The Debian Package install-debian
----------------------------

This shell script intended for using with Live, Network Boot or any bootable
media other then Your system disk where You are going to install the new system
to.  Don't run it withing running Debian System from hard disk - You may
destroy operating system and all data on the disk.

To install Debian it may be enough to invoke install-debian without parameters.
But it is strongly recommended for the first time issue:

install-debian -s

to see default values and decide if You are satisfied with it.
